# navbar_static
Building a nav bar that is semi responsive 

Building a navbar with a simple icon and list items for the links.
Was not looking at the functionality of the actual list items to become links.
I am looking at playing with display properties in css and getting more proficient in things such as positions and media queries.
Lots of work trying to make the page responsive to the different viewport sizes.
